Cloudgarden's
Jigloo GUI
Builder is
a plugin for IBM's <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="_blank">Eclipse</a>
Java IDE and <a href="http://www.ibm.com/websphere/studio"
 target="_blank">WebSphere
Studio</a> IDEs, which allows you
to build
and manage both<i> </i>Swing and SWT GUIs.<br
 style="font-family: verdana;">
      </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">Jigloo
creates and
manages code
for
all the parts of the GUI as well as
code to handle events, and shows you the GUIs as
they are being built, allowing you to experiment with various
properties of controls/components as well as the more complex
features of the Swing GridBagLayout or SWT's FormLayout, for instance. </font><font
 face="Arial" size="-1">Jigloo
is
straightforward, powerful
and easy
to use and can lead to a very large time-saving (over
hand-coding) for GUI
development and maintainance tasks. Also, because Jigloo
is integrated with the
Eclipse IDE the invaluable code-management features of Eclipse are
immediately available to further modify the generated code. </font></td>

Below is a screenshot of Jigloo (click on it for the full-sized image
in a new window), being used (in a Windows platform) to
build a GUI similar to the Eclipse GUI. In the GUI editor, "button5" is
highlighted with a blue border, and it's properties, layout, layout
constraints and event handlers are shown ready for editing in the lower
"GUI Properties" view. The tree view of the whole form is shown in the
"Outline" view on the right-hand side. The context menu is showing for
button5, ready to jump to the java code for the "widgetSelected" event
handler.<br>

Jigloo
has been tested successfully on the Windows and Linux (GTK) platforms.
It will also run on the Mac OS X, but it can be used only for SWT GUIs.
It has not been tested on other platforms, but may perform successfully
on them.<br style="font-family: verdana;">

<br>
<b><a name="examples"></a>Examples<br>
</b><br>
Some examples are contained in the file <a href="jiglooexamples.zip">jiglooexamples.zip</a>
. <br>
<br>
The above zip file contains form and java files in a "exampleForms"
package folder, as well as an "icons" folder. To look at them you can
import them into your existing project (you will need to set your
project up to run SWT classes, as described in the "Installation"
section below). The examples are:<br>
</font>
<ul>
  <li style="font-family: verdana;"><font face="Arial" size="-1">DummyEclipse.form
- demonstrates how an Eclipse-like GUI can be built<br>
    </font> </li>
  <li style="font-family: verdana;"><font face="Arial" size="-1">FormLayoutTest.form
- demonstrates four controls in a SWT FormLayout<br>
    </font> </li>
  <li style="font-family: verdana;"><font face="Arial" size="-1">TestJApplet1.form
- demonstrates many Swing features<br>
    </font> </li>
  <li style="font-family: verdana;"><font face="Arial" size="-1">TestJInternalFrame.form
- a
JInternalFrame used by TestJApplet2 - you need to compile and build
this before opening TestJApplet2<br>
    </font> </li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">TestJApplet2.form
- like
TestJApplet1.form, but includes an import of TestJInternalFrame (see
"tab3"). <br>
    </font> </li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial" size="-1"><br>
<br>
<b><a name="installation"></a>Installation<br>
</b><br>
Like any eclipse plugin, shut down eclipse, extract the jigloo201.zip
file
into your eclipse installation folder - the
"com.cloudgarden.jigloo_2.0.1" folder should end up inside the
"plugins" directory. Then start up eclipse, and consult the jigloo <a
 href="jigloo.html#docs">documentation</a>
(see the "Documentation" section
below).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
If you will be running SWT applications inside Eclipse,
it is important that you read the "Preparing your project to use the
SWT classes" part of the "Getting Started" section of the "Jigloo GUI
Builder Guide".<br>
<br>
If upgrading from a previous release, you will need to delete that
folder (eg, delete "com.cloudgarden.jigloo_1.0.0"
if
upgrading from version 1.0.0), so that there is only one
com.cloudgarden.jigloo_n.n.n plugin
folder.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="docs"></a>Documentation<br>
</b><br>
You can browse the "Jigloo GUI Builder User's Guide" online <a
 href="doc/index.html">here</a>.<br>
<br>
The guide is also contained in the Jigloo plugin - after
you install Jigloo, open up the "Help-&gt;Help Contents" menu and go to
the entry for "Jigloo GUI Builder Guide". If you will be running SWT
applications inside Eclipse, it is important that you read the
"Preparing your project to use the SWT classes" part of the "Getting
Started" section of the "Jigloo GUI Builder Guide".<br>

<br>
</font><small><font face="Arial"><b>Version 2.0.1
- released Jan 7th 2004. <br>
</b></font></small><small><font face="Arial">
- Bug-fix release, (mainly bugs related to Swing components, and
performance on a Mac).<br>
- Bug fixed: layout of SWT Dialog in generated Java code did not
correspond to layout in GUI builder.<br>
- Bug fixed: bug made it impossible to add, or cut/paste, some Swing
components<br>
- Bug fixed: CoolBar contents were not displayed in Java code generated
on Mac.<br>
- Bug fixed: CoolItems were not correctly sized (this was worse on a
Mac)<br>
- Bug fixed: Font chooser dialog did not work on a Mac.<br>
<br>
</font></small><small><font face="Arial"><b>Version 2.0.0
- released Jan 5th 2004. <br>
</b></font></small><small><font face="Arial">
- All feaures are available for non-commercial as well as commercial
use:</font></small><small> <font face="Arial"><i>(ie, there are no
longer two separate Standard and Professional
editions), but commercial use still requires purchase of a Professional
License.</i><br>
</font></small><small><font face="Arial">- Creation of SWT Dialogs now
supported.<br>
- Double-click on components allows quick edit of a component's "text"
property.<br>
- Creation dialog allows "text" and image properties and layout options
to be
entered quickly and easily (and for default layout preferences to be
set).<br>
- Option to have "GUI Properties" view displayed as tabbed panel, with
tabs for "Properties", "Layout" and "Events".<br>
- Added individual icons for all SWT and Swing components (in outline
and context menus).<br>
- Layouts can also be changed using the "GUI Properties" view, not just
by a right-click option.<br>
</font></small><small><font face="Arial">- Added preInitGUI() and
postInitGUI() methods for
inserting custom code before and after auto-generated GUI code.<br>
- Nows runs on Mac OS X (but with support for SWT GUIs only).<br>
</font></small><small><font face="Arial">
- Several minor bugs fixed: inability to set defaultCloseOperation for
JFrame, sizing of CoolBars.<br>
<br>
</font></small><small><font face="Arial"><b>Version 1.0.3
- released Nov 29th 2003. <br>
</b>- The "Run" menu option now always does a build before
running (instead of only if the form has been modified).<br>
- Fixed a bug which resulted in SWT Grid Layouts sometimes not being
generated as seen in Jigloo (specifically, the widthHint and heightHint
parameters for components inside a Grid layout were not always set
equal to the size of the control).<br>
</font><font face="Arial"><br>
</font></small><small><font face="Arial"><br>
</font></small><font face="Arial" size="-1">
<b>Version 1.0.2
- released Nov 11th 2003. </b><br>
- Added support for WebSphere Studio IDEs (version
5.1.0 tested).<br>
- Added JTree to Swing component menu.<br>
- Fixed bug which prevented creation of a new GUI form
in the project root folder.<br>
<br>
<b>Version 1.0.1
- released Nov 6th 2003.</b><br>
- Fixed bug
apparent when creating a new GUI form in the default package. Fixed bug
apparent after 10-day trial period expired.<br>
