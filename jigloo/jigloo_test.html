Cloudgarden's
Jigloo GUI
Builder is
a plugin for IBM's <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="_blank">Eclipse</a>
Java IDE and <a href="http://www.ibm.com/websphere/studio"
 target="_blank">WebSphere
Studio</a> IDEs, which allows you
to build
and manage both<i> </i>Swing and SWT GUIs.</font><font face="Arial"
 size="-1"> Jigloo
creates and
manages code
for
all the parts of the GUI as well as
code to handle events, and shows you the GUIs as
they are being built, allowing you to experiment with various
properties of controls/components as well as the more complex
features of the Swing GridBagLayout or SWT's FormLayout, for instance. </font><font
 face="Arial" size="-1">Jigloo
is
straightforward, powerful
and easy
to use and can lead to a very large time-saving (over
hand-coding) for GUI
development and maintainance tasks. Also, because Jigloo
is integrated with the
Eclipse IDE the invaluable code-management features of Eclipse are
immediately available to further modify the generated code.<br>
      </font>
      <p style="font-family: verdana;"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Components
are added, layouts changed etc, by selecting from a component/layout
palette, or by options in the
right-click context menus. They can be resized and dragged about in the
form editor and in the outline view, and their properties, layout
constraints and event handlers can be
changed easily in the "GUI Properties" view. Multiple components can be
selected at the same time and properties, layouts etc changed on all
selected components at the same time, making widespread changes easy to
perform. The class of a component can also be easily changed (eg, from
a Composite to a Group, a combo-box to a text field, or to any custom
class). There are buttons in the form editor to provide a quick preview
of the form (to test it's "handling") or to actually run the generated
code. Custom classes can be added to forms, and JavaBeans with
Customizers and custom properties are supported.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p style="font-family: verdana;"><font face="Arial" size="-1">A
basic knowledge of the Swing and SWT
components is useful, but not essential - and the javadoc can be easily
accessed (by a right-click option) directly from the GUI editor.</font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="-1">Jigloo
has been tested successfully on the Windows and Linux (GTK) platforms
with Eclipse 2.1.2 and 3M6.

Mac OSX platform it can be used to generate SWT GUIs (Swing GUIs
cannot be built on a mac as yet). <br>
It has
not been tested on other platforms, but may perform successfully
on them.<br>

Below is a screenshot of Jigloo (click on it for the full-sized

in a new window), being used (in a Windows platform). In the GUI
editor, a panel in a JTabbedPane is
highlighted with a black-and-blue border (the blue parts can be grabbed
with the mouse to drag the component), and it's properties, layout,
layout
constraints and event handlers are shown ready for editing in the lower
"GUI Properties" view. The tree view of the whole form is shown in the
"Outline" view on the right-hand side. <br>

<a name="history"></a><b>Revision History</b><br>
<br>
</font><small><font face="Arial"><b>Version 2.6.0
- released Feb 3rd 2004. <br>
</b></font></small><small><font face="Arial">- Added infinite undo/redo
support
for grouped changes (ie, changes on multiple components
simultaneously), for layout and layout constraint changes, and for cut,
paste and delete (ie, for all actions).<br>
- Better support for SWT fonts - underline and strikeout fonts now
available for Windows platforms.<br>
- Better support for Swing fonts - correct list of Swing fonts now
displayed (which is slightly different from SWT set).<br>
</font><font face="Arial"> - Support for non-visual components <br>
- Better formatting of generated code (no need now to use the Jigloo
preference
to automatically format code). <br>
- Generated code re-uses SWT resources (Images, Colors and Fonts) where
possible.<br>
- Comments added to generated code<br>
- Works with Java 1.5.0 beta.<br>
</font><font face="Arial">- Some Swing components added to the palette
(JOptionPane, JSpinner, JFormattedTextField) <br>
- Locale editor added.<br>
- Bug Fixed: the GridBagLayout editor mode should now not set large
values for gridx/y, gridheight/width</font></small><br>
<small><font face="Arial">- Bug Fixed: In some situations, impossible
to drop components on
Groups or Composites.<br>
- Bug Fixed: When running code, if menus added to GUI, then a JDialog
was smaller than designed while a Composite was bigger, both by the
height of the menu bar.<br>
</font></small><small><font face="Arial">- Several other bugs fixed.</font></small><br>
<small><font face="Arial"><br>
</font></small><small><font face="Arial"><b>Version 2.5.0
- released Feb 3rd 2004. <br>
</b></font></small><small><font face="Arial">- Component/Layout palette
added to top of form editor - as well as dropping elements directly on
the form elements can also be dropped in the Outline view, which is
useful for populating menus and containers whose children fill the
container space, such as a SashForm.<br>
- Anchor dialog for components in Form or Anchor layouts - allows all
four sides to be anchored at once, and for multiple components.<br>
- Border around selected
component changed to include regions where component can be dragged to
a different location (instead of just resized).<br>
- Support for customizers and custom properties of JavaBeans.<br>
- When new components are added, they appear on top of all other
components, allowing them to be easily moved.<br>
- Constant fields written explicitly in code instead of as numbers (eg,
SWT.PUSH instead of it's numerical value).<br>
- CheckBoxes for boolean properties (toggled by single or
double-clicks) instead of drop-downs - cuts down
on mouse clicks. To choose between single or double-click to toggle
boolean property, use the Jigloo preferences page.<br>
- Parts of forms can be extracted and saved as new forms.<br>
- The "GUI Properties" view shows the component(s) currently selected
in it's title.<br>
</font></small><small><font face="Arial">- Limits placed on
re-parenting of Swing components - eg, JButtons cannot now be placed
inside other JButtons.<br>
- Generated event handlers are protected instead of public.<br>
- "Run", "Preview" etc buttons moved to Outline view.<br>
- Update site used to release plugin
(http://www.javametric.com/update-site/).<br>
- Bug fixed: problems finding custom classes or images<br>
- Bug fixed: sometimes
changing a multiple-choice property in the property editor would not be
effective.</font></small><br>
<small><font face="Arial">- Bug fixed: small problems with moving &amp;
copying multiple components in Form Editor<br>
- Bug fixed: imported Netbeans event handlers were duplicated<br>
- Bug fixed: Setting a Box Layout on a JInternalFrame failed.<br>
- Bug fixed: Images were not found if source folder was not "src" or
the root folder of the project - and image file dialog was not
correctly initialized.<br>
- Bug fixed: Components were renamed on cut &amp; paste.<br>
- Bug fixed: declarations of child components were not removed when
parent component was removed<br>
<br>
