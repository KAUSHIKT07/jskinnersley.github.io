<br>
</b></big></u>You can download the eigtth beta release of Jigloo 2.9.0 <a href="http://cloudgarden.soft-gems.net/jigloo290beta8.zip">here</a> (note, this is very close to being the final version, which will be released as version 3.0.0)<br>
<br>
Changes from the previous beta releases:</font><br>
<ul>
  <li><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Last (hopefully) of the major bugs fixed</font></small><br>
</li><li><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Examples
updated - now the Inheritance/JavaBean example creates a Java Bean with
a Customizer, custom editor and icon (you can create an example using
Eclipse's "New" wizard - under "GUI Forms-&gt;Examples").</font></small><br>
</li><li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small>Documentation updated and corrected!</small></font></li>

  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small>Right-click
option to re-format the code using the current coding style (eg,
convert an existing class from using getters to using blocks of code
separated by blank lines)</small></font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small>Right-click option to migrate to Jigloo 3.0 style of code (convert to using SWTResourceManager, and insert new showGUI method) <br>
    </small></font></li>
<li><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">"Class
Creation" tab added to the preferences page - this allows you to
fine-grain select which classes will and won't be instantiated by
Jigloo as it parses your java file - this can be used to avoid unwanted
effects caused by Jigloo trying to instantiate classes that are not essential to designing the form.</font></small><br>
  </li>
<li><font size="-1"><font face="Arial">Beta 4 bugs fixed:
AnchorLayout now works, mouse-positioning bug fixed on
Linux/Eclipse3.0, error when creating event handler has been fixed,
previews of JDialog and JFrame now correct.</font></font><br>
  </li>

  <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">Generated code is now formatted by the eclipse code-formatter (so consistent with user-defined code styles)</font></li>

  <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">New visual classes can now be created as sub-classes of existing visual classes using the "new" wizard to specify the superclass</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">Extension of JFrames and JDialogs now also supported (in beta 3 it was only possible to extend JPanels, Composites, Groups etc)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">some bugs fixed (including a mouse-click useability bug on linux)<br>
    </font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">Please treat it as a beta release, and don't use it for production work yet (unless you have tested it to your satisfaction).<br>
It is recommended that you install it in a separate installation of Eclipse and work on copies of your files.<br>
It has been tested on Windows, in Eclipse versions 2.1.3 and 3.0 (final release).<br>
Feedback concerning behaviour on other platforms will be welcome.<br>
<br><b>
Please post bug reports and requests for new features</b> to the <a target="_top" href="http://www.cloudgarden.com/forums.html">Cloudgarden Jigloo forum</a>.<br>
<br>
This version is a major departure from previous versions in that it
does not use .form files to store the GUI, but instead parses the java
class files to construct the GUI internally. There were two main
reasons for this:<br>
<br>
1) It allows java classes generated by other GUI builders (eg, Visual
Editor Project, Visual Age, JBuilder, Netbeans, etc) or by hand to be
manipulated by Jigloo.<br>
2) It allows users to modify the generated code without it being overwritten by Jigloo.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b>: If you have .form files open in version 2.7.2 of Jigloo,
you must close them before opening the .java files in Jigloo 2.9.0 beta.<br>
eg, if you have TestFrame.<b>form </b>already open, close it, then open TestFrame.<b>java<br>
<br>
Note: To open a .java file in Jigloo 2.9.0 for the first time, you
right-click on the file in Eclipse's PackageExplorer, and choose "Open
with-&gt;Form Editor" - after a java file has been opened once with
Jigloo, double-clicking the file will again open it with Jigloo.<br>
</b><br>
The other main features of this version are:</font><br>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">Inheritance for top-level
classes is supported - ie, you can edit a class, say ExtendedJPanel,
which extends NewJPanel, which extends JPanel, and have access to the
publically-accessible components of NewJPanel while editing
ExtendedJPanel.<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">Inheritance
for form elements is supported - eg, if you include an instance of
NewJPanel as a component of a GUI class you are building, then you can
access the </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">publically-accessible components of NewJPanel while editing your main class.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">Easy navigation between code and gui elements</font></li>

  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">selecting a gui element in the form editor takes you to the element's assignment in code</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">moving the cursor in the code selects and reveals the respective gui element.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">clicking on a property in the GUI property editor takes you to property setter in code.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">When the form editor is maximized,
the form outline and GUI properties views appear inside the form editor
editor (so that the editor can be used fully when maximized).</font></li><li><font face="Arial" size="-1">Components
can be shuffled inside Flow, Row, Fill, Grid layouts, or within
JSplitPanes, by dragging the components inside the form editor
(preiously they could only be rearranged in the Outline view).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">Blocks of code can be protected from
modification by Jigloo by surrounding them with user-specifiable
comments (by default, if a block of code is preceded by
"//$protect&gt;&gt;$" and followed by "//$protect&lt;&lt;" then Jigloo
will not delete or update any of the code inside that block (though it
may add code inside the block).</font></li><li><font face="Arial" size="-1">Blocks
of code can be hidden from
parsing by Jigloo by surrounding them with user-specifiable
comments (by default, if a block of code is preceded by
"//$hide&gt;&gt;$" and followed by "//$hide&lt;&lt;" then Jigloo
will not parse any of the code inside that block). This is useful if,
say, you have an if/else block with two different sets of GUIcode - you can design one by "hiding" the other, and vice-versa. <br>
    </font></li>


  <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">Code-parsing can be toggled on and
off by use of a button added to Outline (allows significant changes to
be made to code without overhead of continual parsing). Also, pressing
"Ctrl+Alt+P" will toggle parsing.<br>
</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">Holding Alt down while clicking in
the java editor causes the relevant GUI element to be revealed in the
Outline view, instead of the Java element.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">Models for JComboBox, JList,
JSpinner, JTable are generated and parsed (and model property can be
set to any suitable model defined in code). Changes to models made in
the code are reflected in the form editor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">String array properties are
recognized (this means that the setItems methods of the SWT List and
Combo controls are interpreted in the form editor).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">Various code-generation options -
getter methods (like JBuilder, VEP etc) or code in main block
(separated either with braces, tagged comments or newlines).</font></li><li><font face="Arial" size="-1">Existing code can be easily re-formatted to the current coding style<br>
</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial" size="-1">Code-style of generated code is obtained from the user-defined formatting style<br>
</font></li>

  <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">JFace viewers added.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="-1">Form files can still be saved by using the setting in the Jigloo preferences page. <br>
</font></li>
</ul><font face="Arial" size="-1">Some tips on getting to know this version:<br>
<br>
1) Open an existing Java file, by right-clicking on it in Package Explorer and choosing "Open with...-&gt;Form Editor"<br>
2) Select a component in the form editor - notice how the java editor scrolls to the assignment statement for that component.<br>
3) In the java editor, click or move the cursor using the arrow keys
and notice how the form editor selects the component based on your
position in the code (scrolling the component to be visible if
necessary).<br>
4) Select a property (or an event handler) in the GUI Properties editor
- the java code should scroll to highlight the code that sets that
property (if it has been set in the code).<br>
5) Open up the Jigloo preferences page (under Window-&gt;Preferences) and experiment with some of the settings.<br>
