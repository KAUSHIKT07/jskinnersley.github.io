<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="80%"><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Now that the
war in Iraq has started, there is all the more reason to speak out against
the war. We respect the potential sacrifices soldiers make in going into
battle, but believe that there is still no just cause for going to war
in the first place. I have included below several of today's <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/113324_ltrs20.shtml">Seattle
Post-Intelligencer's letters to the editor</a>. They talk of the huge global
benefits if only a fraction of the money to be spent on war were used to
eliminate the basic humanitarian problems of the world, the lack of just
cause, the dire state of the US economy, and the huge problem of rebuilding
Iraq that Bush minimizes or ignores.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>There are many excellent reasons for
working to find a peaceful solution to the Iraq crisis - a crisis which
has been created by the US, which has no connection to the terrorist attacks
of September 11th, and which has turned world sympathy for the US into
a growing distrust and hatred of the American people.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>While there is no doubt that Saddam
is a tyrant, there is no reason to put the fate of the world in the hands
of a bully. Bush has precious little concern for the livelihood of the
majority of people living in the US, has no appreciation or respect for
the global political or natural environment (as well as the natural environment
of the US), and no real respect for the lives of Iraqi civilians. He became
the president of the US by being a bully, and he threatens to disregard
the wishes of the UN while bribing UN members over to his side. If he flaunts
the UN (especially after breaking so many important international treaties
- global warming etc) then he has no justification for attacking a country
on the grounds that it is breaking UN orders.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Despite what he says, he does not
have the best interests of the Iraqi people at heart, who are terrified
at having bombs fall on them (after all, it is estimated that 10,000 Iraqi
civilians will die in an attack which will create 1,000,000 refugees).
He cannot be allowed to split human beings into US citizens and the rest
of the world when it comes to the value of life. Nor does he seem to be
overly concerned for the people in America likely to be the brunt of increased
terrorist attacks if he starts a war in Iraq.&nbsp;</font></font>

<h3>
<font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Peace rhetoric shouldn't stop when battle
begins&nbsp;</font></font></h3>
<font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>With war upon us, there will now be calls
for those who have opposed this tragedy to silence ourselves. It's as if,
having struggled to stave off an encroaching fire, one is supposed to look
on approvingly as the house goes up in flames.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>When my government proposes actions
I consider harmful to the interests of this nation and to the world, I
consider it my duty to oppose them. That responsibility does not diminish
when the government actually takes such actions.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Even as acts of war go, bombing cities
is barbaric. Going to war means our hands are caked with blood. For that
reason alone, the standard for doing so is very high. It is not met in
the present instance and commencing hostilities does not change that.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>This administration has deliberately
misled Americans about this war, and I am not about to support the man
who holds the office of president merely because he happens to occupy it
and wields his power with a recklessness unprecedented in U.S. history.
How can one "support our troops" by keeping silent when the president risks
their lives unnecessarily?</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>President Bush assumes that in resorting
to military force he will have the unquestioning support of Americans,
no matter how disastrous the consequences. To silence ourselves now would
be to announce to this administration, and to those that follow, that we
will never hold them to account. What could be more irresponsible?</font></font>

<h3>
<font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Consequences of war might be inconceivable&nbsp;</font></font></h3>
<font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>I thank U.S. Sen. Tom Daschle for his
comments regarding President Bush's failed diplomacy. However, it is too
little too late.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Maybe if Democrats had started all
of this sooner, the Republicans may have been defeated. Instead, the Democrats
blew a wonderful opportunity to show the world that America is still a
member of the world community and not some rogue state intent on world
domination.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>The world's view of the United States
is quickly degenerating into frightening dislike and near hatred. The precedent
set by this court-appointed president might have inconceivable consequences
for this country in the years to come. Let's just hope the damage done
will not be too harmful.</font></font>

<h3>
<a NAME="just cause"></a><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>When troops
are sent, the cause should be just&nbsp;</font></font></h3>
<font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>When a man goes through contortions to
justify his actions, something is usually amiss. Take President Bush's
St. Patrick's Day ultimatum, along with Colin Powell's news conference
of the same day: Both men put a lot of weight on United Nations Resolution
1441 to authorize a U.S. invasion, and yet the same United Nations is withholding
support for the invasion. Also by trying to bribe Security Council members,
offering them new foreign aid packages contingent on support for a second
resolution (only to lose anyway), the administration has disgraced the
country in the eyes of the world.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>I'm no enthusiast for the United Nations
or for world government in any form, but by going to the United Nations,
in effect the United States submitted the matter to arbitration. When the
arbitrator rules in an unexpected or undesired way, a party to the arbitration
is not justified in walking out and treating the issue as if the arbitrator's
view doesn't matter.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>We can support U.S. troops by bringing
them home from the Middle East. We can support U.S. troops by dissuading
their commander in chief from committing them to a grand crime. We can
support our Catholic troops by allowing them to live in accord with just-war
doctrine.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Yes, there is such a thing as just
war. But, among other religious leaders, the pope is convinced a U.S. invasion
of Iraq is not justifiable. We owe our troops a just cause.&nbsp;</font></font>

<h3>
<a NAME="tax cuts"></a><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Promised tax cuts
are needed elsewhere&nbsp;</font></font></h3>
<font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>With 9/11, the flags came out and patriotism
seemed to be measured by how large the flag or how many flags were flying.
Then came the downturn in the economy and now the war with Iraq. To me,
the sign of true patriotism is the willingness of its citizens to make
sacrifices to help keep the country afloat. The "no more taxes" campaign
should have been muted by 9/11 and its aftermath. I am amazed that the
Bush administration and the Republican Party do not consider the war on
terrorism, the faltering economy and now the Iraqi war as significantly
valid reasons to reverse the decisions relating to tax cuts made prior
to these events.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>It is extremely important for U.S.
patriots to contact their congressional representatives now and let them
know that they are willing to forgo a tax cut to help support this country
through these trying times. Those of us who love this country hate to see
it going through such turmoil. We need to continue to support the federal
government financially so that it can begin to help improve the economy,
get the unemployed back to work, pay for the war on terrorism and now the
new war with Iraq.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>For many of us, taxation is our only
opportunity to serve our country. It is through taxation that this country
has maintained its prosperity and effectiveness. All its patriots, individuals
and corporations, should be willing to pay their fair share to make this
country great again.</font></font>

<h3>
<font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Bush regime will not emerge a winner&nbsp;</font></font></h3>
<font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>I saw David Horsey's cartoon in Tuesday's
issue. It was reassuring to see that someone is pointing out that the Bush
face is masking something more complex and perhaps worth thinking critically
about. The William Safire column located immediately below Horsey's cartoon
was an amazingly rosy-hued conservative counterpoint.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Counting on nothing but success and
zero blowback in the Middle East to deliver a resounding victory for the
Bush regime in a couple of years makes Safire a candidate for optimist
of the century. Seeing these two contrasting views together made me wonder,
how is it that Osama bin Laden, in little more than a year since the 9/11
attacks, has become George Bush's and the Republican right's greatest political
ally? Greater perhaps than even Tony Blair.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>I sure hope Osama understands and
uses his newfound American king-making power wisely. The more terrifying
thought, far scarier than either the fear or reality of radiological weapons,
biological or nuclear attack on American soil, is the possibility that
Bush may be Osama's greatest ally as well.&nbsp;</font></font>

<font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Why are we attacking Iraq? It is like
using a sledgehammer to kill a flea. After 9/11, we were going to eliminate
terrorists worldwide.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Hold it, perhaps I can answer my own
question. We are attacking Iraq so we can lure the terrorists out of hiding
and have them attack us here at home, that way we can see who they are.
That explains the Orange alert, doesn't it? Wow! What a strategy! We sure
have smart people leading us.</font></font>

<h3>
<font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Bush wants to pull strings of a puppet&nbsp;</font></font></h3>
<font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>I have read the U.N. resolutions regarding
the government of Iraq and agree that the use of force to disarm it is
authorized without further action by the Security Council.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>This, however, does not mean I agree
with the tyrannical and despotic behavior of our current administration
and, specifically, President Bush.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Bush and his administration seem to
have their own agenda, as though this conflict were pre-determined. I don't
believe this conflict is about disarmament. I believe Resolution 1441 is
simply a means for the president to remove a dictator and replace him with
a puppet government, no matter what the cost.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>The United States is supposed to be
the world leader in democracy, but our government has not acted according
to the will of the people. The American public has been fed lies, false
accusations and rhetoric so confounding that the average citizen doesn't
know what to believe.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Public opinion polls now show support
for this invasion, but are they accurate? I believe Americans have simply
accepted a war they had no say in, and now support our troops in their
endeavors.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>In the past, the United States has
been respected by countries around the world as a fair and just nation.
A nation to be sought out in times of humane rights violations, oppression,
famine and disaster, a nation of high morality and standards of conduct.
This world opinion is part of what makes me proud to be an American. However,
my pride has somewhat diminished over recent events.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>World opinion is now against us. We
have become the dictator, the warmonger, the tyrant and the despot.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>The media are saturated with politicians
and news personalities throwing the blame at one another. It's the Democrats,
it's the Republicans, it's France, it's Sen. This or Sen. That. So and
so supported this back then, etc.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Let's stop the bull and put the blame
where it should be -- on President Bush. He made the choice to invade.
He defied world opinion. He went against the wishes of our allies. He angered
the world populations. He put our citizens at a heightened risk of terrorist
attack. He put our military in harm's way. He put thousands of innocent
civilians around the world in harm's way.</font></font>

<a NAME="rebuilding"></a><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Rebuilding Iraq
will be monumental task&nbsp;</font></font></h3>
<font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Now that President Bush's war is a certainty,
we must recognize another certainty: War is a blunt and brutal instrument
and there is no way to make war on Saddam Hussein without also making war
on the innocent people of Iraq. Many civilians will be killed and maimed
by our bombs and bullets. Many thousands more will lose their homes and
face starvation and disease.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>For months, Bush has been gathering
a huge invasion force in the Middle East and striving to gather support
for this war. Has he been equally diligent in gathering the resources needed
to feed, clothe and care for the innocent people this war will hurt?&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>The signs are not good. Relief agencies
say the United States has done little to prepare to meet these humanitarian
needs and there's a very real possibility of a humanitarian crisis of catastrophic
proportions.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>I pray this will not come to pass.
I pray that Bush will fulfill his responsibility to the many thousands
of Iraqis whose lives, limbs and homes he is putting at risk. For their
fate now clearly rests in his hands and, thus, in our own.</font></font>

<h3>
<a NAME="fixing global problems"></a><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Fixing
global problems would cost less than war&nbsp;</font></font></h3>
<font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>I admit there are arguments on both sides
of the issue about war against Iraq. When people consider the question,
however, I hope they will keep the following in mind. It has certainly
helped me make up my mind.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>The United Nations has estimated that
it would take about $40 billion to address all basic unmet human needs
in the world; that is, hunger, basic medical care, basic sanitation and
minimal education. This number comes from UNICEF. Although this seems like
a very low number, the reality is that micro loans and vaccination programs
go an incredible distance on a little money compared with the $1 million
cost of one smart bomb and the incredible cost of equipping and maintaining
an divisionary force in Iraq. Forty billion is still a heck of a lot of
money. But for the Iraq war and the rebuilding of Iraq after the war, estimates
range from $400 billion to $600 billion from the U.S. Treasury for the
total bill.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>So what if we call the U.N. basic-needs
figures low, and multiply them fivefold in order to be sure we had enough
to do the job. Call it $200 billion. Then, what if instead of spending
$400 billion to $600 billion to invade Iraq and to rebuild the country
after we destroy much of its infrastructure, we instead decided to simply
let the inspections process continue. Iraq undoubtedly would be contained,
we would avoid the wrath of world opinion now marshaled against us, and
we would avoid violating the U.N. Charter by launching an invasion into
the territory of another member state without the authorization of the
Security Council. These are all good things.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Then suppose we spent $200 billion
toward unmet human needs around the would, again five times what the United
Nations says it would take, but still saving $200 billion to $400 billion
compared with an invasion of Iraq. Can anyone seriously argue that we would
not be more secure having eradicated hunger and other unmet basic human
needs around the world than we would be as the result of an invasion of
Iraq? We could do what humankind has long dreamed of doing, ending unmet
basic human needs. One has to ask: Isn't this more important than invading
Iraq? And we could do it for less than half the cost. Viewed this way,
deciding to invade Iraq instead of ending unmet human needs is an almost
incomprehensible decision.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>I wonder why is it that we are able
to generate the domestic political will to spend $400 billion to $600 billion
on a war that is plainly motivated by anger and fear, but we are unable
to generate the domestic political will to spend $200 billion, or even
$40 billion, to end all unmet basic human needs worldwide, an act that
would be principally motivated by empathy and love for our fellow human
beings. It is odd to me that more people are not discussing this rather
stark dichotomy, including those in the mainstream media. All this leaves
me wondering what our choices say about who we really are as a human species,
peaceful or warlike. The answer, based upon our actions, seems pretty clear.</font></font>
